# QAN SDKs

::lead
Use SDKs to interact with the QAN TestNet.
::

QANplatform's focus is to lower the entry barriers for developers in the web3 space. QANplatform not only allows developers to build smart contracts and web3 solutions in any programming language, but our goal is also to provide Software Development Kits (SDKs) in as many languages as possible.

At the beginning, the QAN TestNet will support SDKs in 3 programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Go), which we will scale up in the upcoming months, with frequent new SDK releases.
